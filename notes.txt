Tuesday
- quick review of where we got to

- comprehensions
- passing command-line arguments (which are ALWAYS strings)
- to add libraries to python:
  - python -m ensurepip
  - python â€“m pip install requests (or any other library you need)
- using requests (to access web API via HTTP)
- strings with triple quotes
- exception handling (try-except etc.)
- debug tools
- review exercise
- File input and output

Wednesday
- brief review so far
- functions, *args, **kwargs  
- functions live in classes, which live in modules which live in packages
- PEP8 style guide
- custom generator and yield
- global and local scope 
- data modelling structures: 
    use built in structures until they do not suit the purpose (then use classes)
- Objects and Classes (OOP)
- get/set as property decorators @property
- name mangling (__) and slots
- properties, methods, __str__
- intrinsic attributes: __doc__ etc.
- special operators and overriding
- inheritance
